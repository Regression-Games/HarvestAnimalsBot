### The Ultimate Collector game mode

The [Ultimate Collector](https://play.regression.gg/documentation/welcome#season-0-ultimate-collector)
game mode features practice and battle modes, where you can program your
bot in isolation and safety, or have it play against our set of bots.
Practice matches do not count towards your leaderboard wins, so make the
best bot possible and enter into a Battle Match to see who wins!

The point values for this game mode are as follows:
