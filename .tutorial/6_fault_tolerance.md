# Handling Edge Cases

The code we have written to get started works great in the expected cases (when
an animal is nearby and we successfully kill it). However, there are many cases
when unexpected events occur.

* What happens if the bot dies?
* What happens if the match ends?
* What happens if the animal gets away?

The `rg-bot` framework provides various event listeners and functions to handle these
edge cases. This code can also be found in the [final_code_advanced.js](#final_code_advanced.js)
