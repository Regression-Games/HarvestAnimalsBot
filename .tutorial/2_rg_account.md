# Create your bot on Regression Games

We will now connect our bot to Regression Games.

Visit https://play.regression.gg and log in, or create an account if you
don't already have one (make sure to connect your GitHub account in your [profile](https://play.regression.gg/account)). Once on Regression Games, visit the 
[**Bot Manager**](https://play.regression.gg/bots) page from the navigation
menu.

from your GitHub. Select the main branch as well.
